Ubuntu VM
=========

This gets me a decent development environment for Ubuntu Trusty LTS

Starring:

* Docker
* Ruby
* Sysdig
* tcpdump
* tmux
* jq
* pv
* fpm
* bundler
* awscli

And lots of other little utilities

For my own reference, this only takes 5 mins to be ready for use on a failrly recent MacBook Pro
